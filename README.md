### Command interpreter functionalities.

* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

### File Storage Engine:
* /models/engine/file_storage.py

## Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: 
``$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash```
